lib7z -- 7z archive manipulation library
(C)Copyright 2004 by Hiroshi Takekawa.

Limitation:

  lib7z can decode almost all .7z files, but some not.  lib7z cannot
  create .7z files so far.

Build:
  To build lib7z, just do './configure && make'.
  To build enfle 7z archiver plugin, do
  $ ./configure --with-enfle-src=/path/to/enfle/src && make
  Then, do
  # cp enfle/.libs/archiver_7z.so /usr/lib/enfle/plugins/archiver/
                                 (/usr/local/lib)
  to install.  Remember run 'enfle -N' to rebuild plugin cache if you
  use it.
